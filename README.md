# Hydra Proof of Concept (POC)

A repository for our colorful prototypes and experiments.

## Development

We provide a `shell.nix` to set up a development environment. So a simple call
to `nix-shell` should put everything in place for building, testing and
general development.

Make sure the following caches are listed in your `nix.conf` for a speedy setup:

```
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://iohk.cachix.org https://hydra.iohk.io
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= iohk.cachix.org-1:DpRUyj7h7V830dp/i6Nti+NEO2/nhblbov/8MW7Rqoo= hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ=
```

Also, some of use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and
[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) to automatically
import the nix-shell environment into our favorite shell or editor.

### Building & Testing

`cabal build` and `cabal test` should work as expected
