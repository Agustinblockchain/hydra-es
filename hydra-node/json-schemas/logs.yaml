  This schema documents the structure of the Log items produced by a Hydra node
  via its standard output stream. Items are emitted as individual JSON objects,
  separated by a newline which makes it easy to ingest by thirdparty tools and
  services.

      description: >-
        A special effect requesting the given event to be delayed from
        processing for some amount of time. Delays can happen in the protocol
        because messages can be received out-of-order due to the asynchronous
        nature of the network, hence an otherwise invalid event could become
        invalid in the future.

      actual details of the transaction and only represent data relevant for the
      protocol to make some progress.
